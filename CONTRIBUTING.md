How the heck do I get all the requirements to contribute?
---------------------------------------------------------

Slowly, unfortunately, and it depends on whether you're running Windows, Mac OS X, or Linux.
The website uses a version of both Ruby and Rails that is not installed by default on most of these platforms.

Mac OS X
--------

We will walk through the steps, but at a high level, they are:

1. Install Xcode
2. Install Xcode's Command Line Tools
3. Install Homebrew
4. Install [RVM (Ruby Version Manager)](http://rvm.io)
5. Install Ruby 1.9.3
6. Clone source
7. Create RVM gemset
8. Install required libraries
9. Contribute!
